### Strategy

#### The Problem

In the workplace, communication can be a challenge. This can especially be the case when particular colleague's shift patterns don't collide, meaning they cannot communicate physically to one another. This can be a problematic issue concerning equipment-based work orders or incidents within the workplace, as the colleague who is aware of the work order/incident may fail to inform their fellow colleagues of it. In the future, another colleague may have to tackle the given work order/incident and due to the previous colleague not informing others of the situation, the current colleague may not be able to solve the situation in the most effective & efficient manner.

#### The Costs

This lack of communication can lead to financial costs to the business in logging multiple work orders, or reputational costs due to poor customer service, as colleagues were not better informed of a particular situation and are therefore portrayed as unprofessional in the eyes of a customer.

#### The Solution

Llama Log's goal is to improve communication between colleague's within a given work environment, allowing for better management over equipment-based work orders and incidents in the workplace.

It's goal is to act as the central hub where employee's can store information regarding particular work orders and incidents. Employee's can then refer to Llama Log whenever they may need to be fully informed of a situation that's previous occured, enabling them to act upon it effectively in the present.

#### The Difference

Communication in the workplace is a problem that's been tackled with the use of software many times, so what will make Llama Log different?

Llama Log will feature a user interface that will not assume that the user is tech-savvy. It will sport a visual language that's familiar, readable and economic to the end user, inspiring them to continue using the application which'll then aid them in achieving their work-related targets. It's design will be inspired by the social media giant [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), as "many marketers report that Facebook is the most effective platform for reaching an older demographic", according to ["How over 50s use social media and the internet"](https://www.digital22.com/insights/how-over-50s-use-social-media-and-the-internet) by Molly Johnston. This will aid Llama Log in being familiar to older users who are less technically inclined, increasing the likelihood that they'll repeatedly use the application.

#### User Goals

Llama Log can help employee's achieve goals such as:

- Providing outstanding customer service consistently.
- Directing visiting engineers towards the source of a equipment-related issue, fixing the issue in a timely manner.
- Communicating effectively with colleagues that they may not work with on a regular basis.

#### Business Goals

Llama Log can help businesses achieve goals such as:

- Saving money by fixing equipment on the first call and not having to make multiple calls to solve a singular issue.
- Creating a collaborative working environment for colleagues, building on their communication skills and confidence when tackling situations they're not fully informed on.
- Store data on the most common equipment faults in the workplace, allowing them to make better informed decisions when purchasing equipment in the future.
- Store data regarding the most common incidents with customers, enabling the business to create relevant learning materials for colleagues regarding such incidents.

#### Opportunities

Below is a table containing a list of opportunities that Llama Log could potentially provide:

| Opportunity/Problem                   | Importance | Feasability |
|---------------------------------------|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Register Employee (Admin)             |      5     |      4      |
| Log In (Admin & Employee)             |      5     |      4      |
| 404 Page                              |      5     |      5      |
| Create & Edit Post (Admin & Employee) |      5     |      5      |
| Comment on Post (Admin & Employee)    |      3     |      3      |
| Responsive Design                     |      3     |      4      |
| Archive Post (Employee)               |      4     |      5      |
| Delete Archived Post (Admin)          |      4     |      3      |
| Form Validation for WO's & Incidents  |      5     |      5      |
| Admin Database Queries                |      2     |      3      |
| Search previous posts                 |      4     |      4      |

Considering that enhancing the communication between colleague's is the essential goal that Llama Log is aiming for, any opportunities that do not directly contribute to this minimum goal will be postponed for a later release of Llama Log.

The opportunity that stands out here in not directly contributing to Llama Log's main goal is Admin Database Queries, which is a feature that enables admins to query data within the database of posts made by colleagues, that could suggest trends in the workplace that the business can act upon. This feature will be postponed and will therefore not make it into the MVP of Llama Log.

### Scope

#### User Requirements

So what would employee's say they need from Llama Log? Employee's need to be able to input information surrounding a work order/incident quickly, so they can promptly return to a task they've currently been assigned to in the workplace. An input form shouldn't contain lots of input fields, nor should it present input fields irrelevant to the employee''s current situation, an example being a work order number input field when the employee is actually attempting to log a situation involving a customer.

The usefulness of Llama Log will be largely dependent on how quick the employee is able to create & read information. Therefore upon logging in, both pieces of functionality need to be present to the employee immediately.

Employee's will likely be reading information in the past and providing employee's are actively using the application, the amount of information will likely build up to a point so much so, that employee's will have to scroll down continuously through vast amounts of information that's irrelevant to them. This can quickly become a tedious and slow workflow, providing a bad user experience. For this reason, a search input field should be immediately present upon logging in. This will enable employee's to promptly search for the information they're looking for.

What they may not know they need however is data validation. The employee will need to insert data into all input fields within the form, in order to make the information regarding a work order/incident useful to themselves or their colleague's in the future. It's important to remember with this in mind not to overload the employee with input field's, as they may not have the time or patience to fill in every minor detail.

#### User Stories

- Be prompted to create a password when I first log in.
- Immediately see the live feed of posts when logging into the app.
- Quickly be able to create a new post when logging into the app.
- Be given an input form that's relevant to my current situation when creating a post.
- Quickly search for previous posts using a search field.
- Edit a post I've previously made.
- Archive posts I've previously made.
- Have a basic avatar image linked to my icon to personalise my account.

**As an Admin, I'd expect Llama Log to enable me in:**

- Creating new employee & admin user accounts.
- Deleting employee & admin user accounts.
- Editing all fields relating to an employee account (except password).
- Completely deleting posts that employee's have archived.

**As a user of Llama Log, I'd expect to:**

- Log in to the app promptly.
- Immediately know what the app is about prior to logging in.
- Be familiar with it's design, so it's easily learnable.
- Immediately tell which information is important based on visual language alone.

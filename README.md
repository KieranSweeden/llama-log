### Strategy

#### The Problem

In the workplace, communication can be a challenge. This can especially be the case when particular colleague's shift patterns don't collide, meaning they cannot communicate physically to one another. This can be a problematic issue concerning equipment-based work orders or incidents within the workplace, as the colleague who is aware of the work order/incident may fail to inform their fellow colleagues of it. In the future, another colleague may have to tackle the given work order/incident and due to the previous colleague not informing others of the situation, the current colleague may not be able to solve the situation in the most effective & efficient manner.

#### The Costs

This lack of communication can lead to financial costs to the business in logging multiple work orders, or reputational costs due to poor customer service, as colleagues were not better informed of a particular situation and are therefore portrayed as unprofessional in the eyes of a customer.

#### The Solution

Llama Log's goal is to improve communication between colleague's within a given work environment, allowing for better management over equipment-based work orders and incidents in the workplace.

It's goal is to act as the central hub where employee's can store information regarding particular work orders and incidents. Employee's can then refer to Llama Log whenever they may need to be fully informed of a situation that's previous occured, enabling them to act upon it effectively.

#### The Difference

Communication in the workplace is a problem that's been tackled with the use of software many times, so what will make Llama Log different?

Llama Log will feature a user interface that will not assume that the user is tech-savvy. It will sport a visual language that's familiar, readable and economic to the end user, inspiring them to continue using the application which'll then aid them in achieving their work-related targets. It's design will be inspired by the social media giant [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), as "many marketers report that Facebook is the most effective platform for reaching an older demographic", according to ["How over 50s use social media and the internet"](https://www.digital22.com/insights/how-over-50s-use-social-media-and-the-internet) by Molly Johnston. This will aid Llama Log in being familiar to older users who are less technically inclined, increasing the likelihood that they'll repeatedly use the application.

#### User Goals

Llama Log can help employee's achieve goals such as:

- Providing outstanding customer service consistently.
- Directing visiting engineers towards the source of a equipment-related issue, fixing the issue in a timely manner.
- Communicating effectively with colleagues that they may not work with on a regular basis.

#### Business Goals

Llama Log can help businesses achieve goals such as:

- Saving money by fixing equipment on the first call and not having to make multiple calls to solve a singular issue.
- Creating a collaborative working environment for colleagues, building on their communication skills and confidence when tackling situations they're not fully informed on.
- Store data on the most common equipment faults in the workplace, allowing them to make better informed decisions when purchasing equipment in the future.
- Store data regarding the most common incidents with customers, enabling the business to create relevant learning materials for colleagues regarding such incidents.
